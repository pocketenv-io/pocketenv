## 🤔 Why Pocketenv?

Modern sandboxes are fragmented and vendor-specific. Each platform has its own API, its own format, and its own ecosystem.

Pocketenv solves this by providing:
- A unified sandbox interface
- Open, portable sandbox definitions
- Vendor-agnostic execution
- Interoperability via [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com) lexicons
- A platform designed for both AI agents and humans

With Pocketenv, sandboxes become portable, shareable, and open.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Secure Isolated Environments**  
  Run commands, agents, and code safely inside isolated sandboxes with strong separation.

- **Vendor-Agnostic Abstraction**  
  Run sandboxes transparently on Daytona, Cloudflare Sandbox, Vercel Sandbox, Deno Sandbox — and more coming.  
  No provider lock-in.

- **Agent-Native Design**  
  Built for modern AI workflows:  
  - OpenClaw  
  - Codex CLI  
  - Claude Code  
  - Gemini CLI  
  - Copilot CLI  
  - …and your custom agents

- **Open Sandbox Definitions via AT Protocol**  
  Sandboxes defined with open lexicons and stored on [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com) PDS. Enables discoverable, shareable, versioned sandboxes and a growing community ecosystem.

## 💡 Example Use Cases

- Prototype and run **OpenClaw** agents safely in isolated environments
- Prototype AI agents in complete safety
- Run Codex / Claude / Gemini / OpenClaw code in isolation
- Securely test untrusted or third-party code
- Share reproducible developer environments
- Spin up temporary / ephemeral dev sandboxes
- Provide sandbox infrastructure as a service for your application
